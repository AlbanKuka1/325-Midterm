Analyzing Voter Registeration in 11 U.S. States including D.C.
The purpose of this project is to get a feel for non-specific, generalized demographic data between the years provided in the dataframe so we can see how population rates have changed between the years within these states as well as the potential ages.
What can the total number of registered voters in each year(2016 & 2020) say about the simple demographics(age,location,population) of registered voters within the given states of this dataframe?
